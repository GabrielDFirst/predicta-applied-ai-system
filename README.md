# Predicta — Applied AI System for SME Operations 

# Overview
Predicta is a WhatsApp-first applied AI system designed to help small and
medium-sized enterprises manage sales records, basic accounting data,
and operational insights through conversational interaction.

The system is actively engineered as a real-world product.  
This repository documents selected technical and architectural components
of Predicta for academic and research demonstration purposes, particularly
in the context of applied machine learning and AI system design.

# What Predicta Is
Predicta is:
- A production-oriented AI system
- Built to operate via WhatsApp interfaces
- Designed for real SME operational use
- Focused on automation, insights, and decision assistance

# What This Repository Is 
This repository is not the full Predicta codebase.

It intentionally presents:
- System architecture abstractions
- Machine learning pipeline design
- Data modelling considerations
- Evaluation and design trade-offs

It intentionally excludes:
- Proprietary business logic
- Production automation flows
- Client data
- Revenue-critical implementations

## System Architecture 
At a high level, Predicta consists of:
- Conversational interface layer (WhatsApp)
- Backend orchestration services
- Data storage and abstraction layer
- Machine learning components for pattern extraction and insights
- Rule-guided inference and response generation
- For a high-level architectural overview, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

Detailed architecture notes are provided in the `/docs` directory.

## Machine Learning Components
Machine learning within Predicta is used to support:
- Pattern detection in transactional records
- Basic forecasting and trend estimation
- Feature extraction from semi-structured inputs
- Decision-support signals rather than autonomous decision-making
- Details of the analytics and ML-ready design are documented in
[`docs/ml_analytics.md`](docs/ml_analytics.md).

The emphasis is on robustness, interpretability, and deployability
rather than purely theoretical optimisation.

## Evaluation Considerations
Evaluation focuses on:
- Practical accuracy under sparse and noisy data
- Stability across small datasets
- Human interpretability of outputs
- Operational usefulness in live environments
- Evaluation methodology and known limitations are documented in
[`docs/evaluation_limitations.md`](docs/evaluation_limitations.md).

## Academic Context
This repository is provided as evidence of:
- Applied AI system design
- End-to-end ML integration
- Deployment-aware engineering decisions
- Translation of ML concepts into operational systems
- A clear distinction between current functionality and planned research
extensions is provided in
[`docs/current_vs_planned_capabilities.md`](docs/current_vs_planned_capabilities.md).

## Disclaimer
This repository is provided for academic and technical review only.
It does not contain the complete Predicta system, production code,
or proprietary implementation details.
