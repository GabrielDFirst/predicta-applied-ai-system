# Current vs Planned Capabilities

This document distinguishes between the current operational capabilities of
Predicta and planned extensions as the system evolves. The distinction is
intentional and reflects responsible applied-AI development.

## System Capabilities Overview

| Component | Current Implementation | Planned / Research Extensions |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| User Interface | WhatsApp-based conversational interaction | Multimodal input and richer conversational context |
| Data Ingestion | Manual entry via messages | Semi-automated ingestion and validation |
| Data Storage | Structured operational records | Feature stores and derived representations |
| Analytics | Rule-based summaries and trends | Statistical and ML-driven analytics |
| Forecasting | Limited or heuristic-based | Time-series and probabilistic forecasting |
| Pattern Detection | Threshold-based signals | Anomaly detection and pattern learning |
| Decision Support | Human-in-the-loop guidance | Adaptive, context-aware recommendations |
| Explainability | Textual summaries | Model-based explanations and uncertainty estimates |
| Evaluation | Offline and operational checks | Longitudinal and comparative evaluation |
| Safety & Ethics | Logging and basic safeguards | Formal monitoring and bias analysis |

## Rationale for Phased Development

Predicta adopts a phased capability strategy to balance immediate operational
value with long-term research goals. Early emphasis on rule-based analytics
ensures stability and interpretability under sparse data conditions.

Planned extensions introduce machine learning incrementally as data volume,
quality, and system maturity increase.

## Research Relevance

The phased evolution of Predicta enables investigation into:
- Transitions from rule-based to model-based systems
- Learning under data sparsity
- Human trust and interpretability in AI-assisted decision-making
- Deployment-aware evaluation strategies

These questions are transferable across multiple applied AI domains.

## Summary
The distinction between current and planned capabilities reflects a deliberate
engineering and research strategy, aligning real-world deployment constraints
with long-term machine learning exploration.
